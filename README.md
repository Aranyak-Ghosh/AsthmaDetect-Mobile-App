# SeniorProject

A front end application developed as part of senior design project at American University of Shrajah which helps people monitor Asthma and COPD condition and records and stores heartrate and oxygen saturation. Additionally the application allows the user to view the severity calculated by the back end application (see SeniorServer) using an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System
